# Project Planning

## Problem Statement

### Primary User
Me (student in python programming and software development class)

### User Needs statement

I am looking for a way to save the information of sold listings on Ebay.

Currently a user of Ebay can manually retrieve records of items
that have been sold on the Ebay platform within the last 2 months.

But instances beyond 2 months are deleted from Ebay's searchable records. This 2-month period
is rolling: If today is 6/16/2018, you will be able to retrieve sold listings on 4/16/2018, but 
tomorrow you will no longer be able to retrieve that data.

A program that would be able to search for sold listings and save the data in a 
csv file would prove useful to users would wish to track the sales history of a particular item 
for periods beyond 2 months, as this functionality currently isn't available.

### Program Steps:

1. Type item name in python input field
2. Program compiles all sold listings matching item description
3. Listings are written to csv file, serving as a historical record of all items sold with that given item name
4. Duplicate entries, identified by same date and item description, will be removed

## Information Requirements

### Information Inputs

A record of a particular item that was sold on Ebay and its attributes, including auction end date, ending price, 
shipping cost, Ebay seller name, size (if applicable) and description. (possibly pictures as well)

### Information Outputs
The inputted data written neatly in a csv file (list of data dictionaries), with future inputs to be added
in the same format.

## Technology Requirements

### APIs and Web Service Requirements
Ebay API

### Python Package Requirements
Ebaysdk - interface into the Ebay APIs

Beautiful Soup - for parsing Ebay data

pytest - for testing 

csv - for csv writing

### Hardware Requirements
This application will run from my personal machine, with no plans to run this application
on a public server.
